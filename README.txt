Systems Programming Final

This was a final project for CS360: Systems Programming. We were to write a small client and server programs, each program of which was run on a different lab machine in the CS building.

To Run: 'make myclient' and 'make myserve' and run the server executable on a different lab machine first. The client is set up to connect to a specific port number which is specified in mftp.h.

***Tested on two CentOS 6 machines***
